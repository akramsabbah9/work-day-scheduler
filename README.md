# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This day planner allows users to construct an hour-by-hour schedule for their daytime activities. The Work Day Scheduler presents the end user with a 9-to-5 schedule and allows them to edit and save events in each hourly block. The list of events is saved in localStorage, allowing them to persist if the user leaves or refreshes the page. Each time block is color-coded to show whether it is in the present, past or future. This application was made with Bootstrap and JQuery.
